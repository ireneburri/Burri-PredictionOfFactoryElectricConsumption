# Factory Electric Consumption Prediction

## Project Description

This project provides a complete machine learning pipeline to predict electric power consumption in factories, based on historical production and environment data. 
The delivered notebook demonstrates preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and submission stages.

This project is based on the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prediction-of-factory-electric-consumption/.
