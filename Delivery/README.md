# Factory Electric Consumption Prediction

## Project Description

This project provides a complete machine learning pipeline to predict electric power consumption in factories, based on historical production and environment data. It is built as a response to the [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prediction-of-factory-electric-consumption/).

The delivered notebook demonstrates preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and submission stages — fully commented in English with meaningful variable names.
